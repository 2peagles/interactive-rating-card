## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Scss](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned
I feel like starting off this project was rather easy, I did the html without adding a ton of divs
 
The progression I really like using scss and the mixins sometimes using classes can get a bit complex and it's hard to name everything then having to remember the names of everything. Using mixins is a time saver. I feel it helps my code to be more readable!

I'm going back to trying to understand javascript better. I kinda knew what I had to do but I wasn't quite sure how to do it. I thought I need a link to go between the ratings page and the thank you page I know it had to be an onclick function to get me there and some sort of checker if you will
if the rating is filled out only then can you go to the next page otherwise return nothing
The other thing was communicating between the two components. I wasn't sure how to do that. I again knew I had to pass the prop down and I thought if I added a link then passed it that way it would work but I also knew that kinda wouldn't work.
 
I did all the css myself then I found this video to help out with the javascript part I was missing

This was very simple and I do think I learn a lot from this and I think now moving forward I'll have a bit more knowledge and I'm just glad I kinda knew what to do and wasn't completely lost!
